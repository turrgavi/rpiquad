# rpiquad
#Raspberry Pi quadcopter source code. Written in Python using standard RPi B+ GPIO pins.

This source code is written in Python v2, it uses 6 GPIO pins: GPIO17, GPIO6, GPIO5, and GPIO4. As well as 4 GND pins and 1 5v Pin.

This will require 4 escs, 4 brushless motors, a Rapsberry Pi B+, a LiPo battery(4200maH preffered), and a quadcopter frame.

Extras may include Dean's connector, gold plated pin connectors etc...
